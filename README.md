# ABSTRACT
A Decentralized Monetary System which tries to achieve Monetary
Equillibrium. We see money as a special product which is specialized to do
the accounting of economic goods and services and make trade efficient
between two parties.
 Since we treat it as a product we believe in demand and
supply of this product when needed by the market but without causing
cantillon effect which changes the share of wealth between economic
actors. So out system increase supply and decreaase it without changing
wealth share of the individuals.
This new system is trying to solve the problem of central bankâ€™s influence
over monetary system and bring back monetary system to the public without
the need of any central authority. To impliment this model in real world
blockchain has played an important role in maintaining independence of its
working.
